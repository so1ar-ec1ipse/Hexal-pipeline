<h1> Pipes puzzles </h1>

<p> <strong>Pipes</strong> puzzle also known as the <strong>Net</strong> or <strong>FreeNet</strong> is 
    a game where your goal is to restore a scrambled network of connections by rotating tiles of the board.
</p>

<p> It is usually played on a grid of squares. 
    That variant is available for example on <a href="https://puzzle-pipes.com" target="_blank">puzzle-pipes.com</a>
    or in Simon Tatham's puzzle <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/net.html" target="_blank">collection</a>.
</p>

<p>This site however contains the same puzzle set on a hexagonal grid. </p>

<h2> <a href="/hexagonal/5">Hexagonal pipes</a></h2>

<p>Hexagonal tiles provide more variety of tile shapes. But otherwise the logic stays the same.</p>

<p>Rotate the tiles to connect them all together with no loops. There are some features to help with the process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Connected tiles will get a random color to help you track what's already in the network.</li>
    <li>Forming loops is forbidden by the rules so the tiles that form a loop will be highlighted with a red background.</li>
    <li>When you're sure of a tile's position you can lock it by right-clicking. This will prevent it from accidentally being rotated out of its correct position.</li>
    <li>You can make edge marks by clicking the border between two tiles. This lets you mark some edges as "definitely a wall" or "definitely a connection".</li>
</ul>

<h2> <a href="/hexagonal-wrap/5">Hexagonal wrap pipes</a></h2>

<p>Wrap pipes are a challenging variation of the puzzle. The connections in this variant are allowed to wrap between borders of the board. You can imagine a copy of the puzzle placed to the right of it. So any connection that goes out to the right comes in from the left. The same with other directions.</p>

<p>Unlike regular pipes puzzles the wrap variant has no convenient outer walls to start the deductions from. Hence its increased difficulty. There are some additional features to help with wrapping:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When you hover over a tile on the border its wrap connections will be highlighted.</li>
    <li>Edge marks made on the outer edges will be automatically copied over to the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try this small wrap puzzle here. There are many more <a href="/hexagonal-wrap/5">hexagonal wrap puzzles</a> for when the regular variant isn't much of a challenge any more.</p>
